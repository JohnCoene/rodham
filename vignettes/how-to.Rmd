## What is this anyway?

`rodham` aims at easing access and analysis of Hillary Rodham Clinton's *personal* emails which are deemed important to the author in light of recent events.

## Get started

The function `search_emails` allows fetching the list of emails that were released. These are available either by calling the Wall Street Journal's [API](graphics.wsj.com/hillary-clinton-email-documents/) or via the built-in dataset (recommended).

```{r opts, echo=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  fig.width = 7,
  fig.height = 5
)
```

```{r setup, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
library(rodham)

# get list of emails
data("emails")

# equivalent to:
em <- search_emails()

identical(emails, em)
```

## Simple Network

Using the list of emails (`data("emails")`) we can plot the network of emails using `edges_emails` which returns a list of edges meant for a directed network.

```{r edges, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
edges <- edges_emails(emails)
knitr::kable(head(edges))
```

The `weight` corresponds to the occurences of edges (number of emails). The list of edges alone allows building a simple network.

```{r simple network, echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE}
g <- igraph::graph.data.frame(edges)
# plot network
plot(g, layout = igraph::layout.fruchterman.reingold(g),
     vertex.label.color = hsv(h = 0, s = 0, v = 0, alpha = 0.0), 
     vertex.size = log1p(igraph::degree(g)) * 2, edge.arrow.size = 0.1, 
     edge.arrow.width = 0.1, edge.width = log1p(igraph::E(g)$weight)/4,
     vertex.frame.color="#FFFFFF")
```

## Get Actual emails

In the above we gather a reasonable amount of meta-data on the emails but we do not get the actual content of the emails. To do so we need to download the emails---as released---in PDF format and extract the text. First we are going to need xpdf to extract the content; you can either download it manually from the [download setion](www.foolabs.com/xpdf/download.html) or you can attempt using  `get_xpdf` (only tested on windows).
`get_xpdf` downloads then unzips the extractor then returns the full path to the pdftotext.exe file required for the next step.

```{r get xpdf, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
xpdf <- get_xpdf(dest = "C:/") # get extractor
# or if you downloaded manually point to pdftotext
# xpdf <- "your/path/xpdfbin-win-3.04/bin64/pdftotext.exe"
```

Once we have the extractor we can fetch some emails using `get_emails`, the function requires you to select a specific `release`, here are the valid ones:

* Benghazi
* June
* July
* August
* September
* October
* November
* January 7
* February 13
* January 19
* February 29
* December
* Non-disclosure

```{r get emails, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
dir <- "D:/rodham" # this is where the emails will be saved
dir.create(dir) # directory must exist
emails_bengh <- get_emails(release = "Benghazi", save.dir = dir, extractor = xpdf)
```

The function downloads, unzips and extracts the content from all email; note that this may take some time. The files will be extracted in a folder named after the requested `release` and its full path returned.

```{r read emails, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
files <- list.files(emails_bengh) # list extracted files
content <- lapply(1:length(files), function(x){
  readLines(paste0(emails_bengh, "/", files[[x]])) # read files
})
```
